The glowing spoon's name is Jimmy. He is super skinny. 
He hates making jokes that are funny. He is really bad at living life,
but he enjoys the little things, like being used to drink soup.
It gives him a purpose to be alive. Jimmy truly does enjoy the little things.

Jimmy also enjoys ice cream. Ice cream is much colder than soup, and Jimmy
always shivers after every spoonful of ice cream. He much prefers warm soup.
 
Another thing that Jimmy likes is cereal. The sweet sugar feels good and he 
likes all the variety with the cereals. Even though the milk in the cereal can
be cold, he doesn't mind it because of the sugar.
