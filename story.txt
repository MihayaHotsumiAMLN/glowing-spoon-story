The glowing spoon's name is Jimmy. He is super skinny. 
He hates making jokes that are funny. He is really bad at living life,
but he enjoys the little things, like being used to drink soup.
It gives him a purpose to be alive. Jimmy truly does enjoy the little things.

Jimmy also enjoys ice cream. Ice cream is much colder than soup, and Jimmy
always shivers after every spoonful of ice cream. He much prefers warm soup.
 
Another thing that Jimmy likes is cereal. The sweet sugar feels good and he 
likes all the variety with the cereals. Even though the milk in the cereal can
be cold, he doesn't mind it because of the sugar.

Jimmy loves to eat, but he also likes to do other, simple things. He likes to clean.
Watching the dirt disappear from under his vacuum was satisfying. Jimmy likes routine.
It makes it easy for him to water his plants every day. They might be fake.

One day our x team went to cs354 lecture and find out that Jimmy is the professor on the stage. Jimmy said happily that  "today we are goinf to talk about dynamic memory allocation. To coaleces a freed block you need to check 3 cases. Then you don't need to overwrite the blockheader of the memory block that has been merged, you can just change the header of the whole block that you merged into ".(ps:jimmy really is my 354 professor lol)
